The employment and recruitment sector in Palestine is currently facing a big problem with time and efficiency. For many years, the process of finding a job or hiring a new employee has been slow and tiring. Many Palestinian students and graduates struggle to find the right opportunities that match their studies, while companies get overwhelmed with hundreds of resumes and find it hard to pick the best person. This project was created to solve these problems by acting as a "front door" for the hiring process in our country.
Our system is designed to save time and effort for both sides of the market. For the applicant, the system is very easy to use. Instead of spending hours searching through ads that don't fit, the user simply uploads his CV to our platform. The system then uses its features to analyze the information inside the CV and automatically matches the applicant with the most suitable job or training opportunities available in our dataset. This way, the applicant doesn't just find "any" job, but the "best" job for their specific career and background.
At the same time, we focused heavily on helping Human Resources (HR) managers and recruiters in Palestinian companies. In most cases, these companies receive so many applications that it becomes impossible to read every single one. This leads to wasting a lot of time and sometimes even missing the best candidates. Our system changes this by automatically extracting the most important data from every CV submitted. Instead of opening file after file, the recruiter gets a full, organized dashboard. This dashboard shows a complete analysis of all applicants, making it easy to compare them and see who fits the company's needs perfectly.
By using these features, our system can join, analyze, and extract all the necessary details to give a full report on every CV. It looks at the existing chances in our dataset and helps the HR manager choose the best candidate without the headache of manual work. This makes the final decision much faster and more accurate, which is better for the company’s growth.
In conclusion, this project is a practical solution for the Palestinian job market. We wanted to create something that makes the path from being a student to being an employee much smoother. By automating the CV analysis and providing a clear dashboard for recruiters, we are helping to modernize how people get hired in Palestine. Our system ensures that talent isn't wasted and that the right people end up in the right places, making the whole recruitment sector more efficient and professional for everyone involved.
